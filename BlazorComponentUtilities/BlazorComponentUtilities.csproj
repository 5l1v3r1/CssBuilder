    <Description>When building complex components for ASP.NET Razor Components there are often CSS classes generated by multiple factors. Styles can often be added by system &amp; component state, public parameters, and static base CSS classes. Combining many CSS classes together doesn't scale well, and when components get large it can be tough to reason about. The CSS builder pattern fixes this problem by offering a easy to repeat, easy to read pattern to use across components in a project. A clean code approach to conditional CSS in Razor Components.</Description>
